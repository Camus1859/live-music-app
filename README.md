### Overall, I found the exercise to be moderately challenging and fun. I went over the time limit because I found it difficult to turn in something incomplete and I spent extra time refactoring the code to ensure readability and scalability in regards to the architecture of the app. I am not very familiar with TDD testing so I decided to focus and spend extra time writing clean code because during my initial interview I was informed of the importance of writing clean and readable code. I took some extra time to incorporate Ticket Masters API which was pretty fun. If given more time, I would write more tests, including e2e and unit tests, sanitize the users inputs, write smaller/more concise commits, and improve on the UI. I would also probably want to implement some sort of caching or rate limit to reduce overloading the server, improve security, and increase the overall speed of the app.
