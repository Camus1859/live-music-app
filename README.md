### Overall, I found building this app to be moderately challenging and fun. I spent extra time refactoring the code to ensure readability and scalability in regards to the architecture of the app. I incorporated Ticket Masters API which was pretty fun. To improve the app I would write more tests, including e2e and unit tests, sanitize the users inputs, write smaller/more concise commits, and improve on the UI. I would also probably want to implement some sort of caching or rate limit to reduce overloading the server, improve security, and increase the overall speed of the app.
